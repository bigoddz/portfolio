        <h1 class="subheading">Introduction</h1>
        <p> Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are large marine mammals that are native to the Arctic regions of the world, including the United States (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway. They are well-known for their iconic appearance, with a thick white fur coat and a stocky body, which is well-adapted for life in the harsh Arctic environment. Polar bears are considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in the Arctic, as their survival is closely linked to the health of the Arctic ecosystem as a whole. Efforts to protect polar bears and their habitat also benefit other species that depend on the Arctic environment for their survival. <p> 
        </p>
        
      
  
        <h1 class="subheading">Physical Characteristics</h1>
        <p>Polar bears have a distinctive appearance with a white fur coat that helps them blend into their snowy environment.
They have a stocky body with a long neck and a large head.
Polar bears have powerful forelimbs with large, partially webbed paws that are adapted for swimming and for navigating through the Arctic ice.
Adult male polar bears can weigh between 900 to 1,600 kilograms (2,000 to 3,500 pounds) and measure around 2.4 to 3 meters (8 to 10 feet) in length, while adult females are smaller, weighing between 300 to 700 kilograms (660 to 1,500 pounds) and measuring around 1.8 to 2.5 meters (6 to 8 feet) in length.
</p>
        <h1 class="subheading">Habitat and Range</h1>
        <p>Polar bears are found in the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia.
They are typically associated with sea ice and are well adapted to living in a cold, harsh environment.
Polar bears spend much of their time on the sea ice, hunting for seals, their main food source, and using the ice as a platform for resting and traveling.

        <h1 class="subheading">Behaviour and Diet</h1>
        <p>Polar bears are excellent swimmers and can cover long distances in search of food.
They are primarily carnivorous and mainly feed on seals, although they will also scavenge on the carcasses of whales and other marine mammals, and occasionally eat fish and berries.
Polar bears are patient hunters, using their keen sense of smell to locate breathing holes in the ice where seals come up to breathe, and then using their strength and speed to catch the seals when they surface.
Polar bears are solitary animals, except for mothers with cubs, and they have a relatively low population density due to their dependence on sea ice for hunting and movement.
